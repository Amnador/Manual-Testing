# Case 01 — Conversation Info Icon Mismatch

This case study documents a visual inconsistency between the Conversation Info icon defined in the design system and the icon shipped in production.

The focus is on:
- Divergence between Figma and the live UI implementation
- Incorrect usage of a generic icon library instead of the approved SVG
- Impact on visual consistency and design system governance
- Clear reproduction steps and a frontend-only remediation plan
